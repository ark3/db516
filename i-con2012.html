<p class="para">
DB516 is proud to announce that we will once again be making our annual appearance at I-CON, Long Island's own science fiction convention! We are back with a greatly expanded set of programming covering a wide variety of fandom topics.
</p>
<div id="more_info" style="display: none">
<p class="para">
As Long Island's Star Wars fan club we will of course be discussing all things Star Wars. Join us at our <i>Star Wars Prequel Trilogy</i> panel for a discussion of Palpatine's plots and Anakin and Obi-Wan's adventures, as well as the recent re-release of The Phantom Menace in 3-D. If classic <i>Star Wars</i> is more your style, our <i>Star Wars Original Trilogy</i> panel will be just what you are looking for. We'll be discussing the adventures of Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewbacca that started it all, as well as the changes that have been made to the trilogy over the years. If that's not enough for you we will also be running both a <i>Star Wars Expanded Universe</i> panel and a <i>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</i> panel. These will be looking at the books, comics, and video games that have expanded the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, and the popular series currently on Cartoon Network.
</p>
<p class="para">
But we're not just a <i>Star Wars</i> club! Our programming at I-CON covers a wide variety of other fandoms! From <i>James Bond</i> to <i>Star Trek</i> and <i>Harry Potter</i> to <i>SouthPark</i>, we'll have something for fans of almost every subject!
</p>
<p class="para">
Fans of science fiction movies and television can join us for our <i>2011 - 2012 Movie Roundup</i>, a look back at the sci-fi, fantasy, and superhero movies of the past year. In the <i>Movies of 2012 Trailer Park</i> we will be looking ahead to this year's most anticipated blockbusters. We will also be talking about which <i>Hollywood Reboots and Sequels</i> have worked well, and which ones really didn't. But don't think it's all about the movies. Not to be forgotten is sci-fi on the small screen. Join us for our discussion of the current state of <i>Science Fiction on Television</i>. Which shows are worth watching? And why do so many keep getting canceled? In addition to this overview many popular programs will have their own discussions as well, including <i>Warehouse 13</i>, <i>Firefly</i>, <i>Stargate</i>, <i>The Vampire Diaries</i>, and <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>.
</p>
<p class="para">
<i>Doctor Who</i> and <i>Torchwood</i> will both have a huge presence at I-CON this year. Docking Bay 516 will be co-hosting several discussions about the popular British show and its spin-off. From Rose to Amy and Rory we will be discussing the <i>Companions of New Doctor Who</i>. We will also be trying to unravel the complicated timeline of <i>River Song.</i> Now that we know most of her story, does it even make sense? Speaking of complicated timelines, we will also be <i>Counting Jacks</i>. Just how many Captain Jacks are sneaking around in Cardiff at any given time? You can also chime in with your opinion on current show-runner Steven Moffat at our panel, <i>In Moffat We Trust(?)</i>. Classic Who fans shouldn't worry though. It's not all New Who. We'll also be looking at some Doctor Who's <i>Greatest Classic Series Moments</i>.
</p>
<p class="para">
Fans of science fiction and fantasy novels should check our new panel, <i>The Book Was Better (Or Was It?)</i>, a discussion of the many sci-fi, fantasy, and young adult novels that Hollywood has turned into successful TV shows and movie franchises. New for I-CON this year are our discussions on the popular teen series <i>The Hunger Games,</i> and the hit HBO series <i>Game of Thrones</i>. And returning to I-CON is our popular <i>Lord of the Rings</i> discussion, which has been newly expanded to include the upcoming film adaptation of <i>The Hobbit</i>.
</p>
<p class="para">
Last but not least, make sure to check out Docking Bay 516's signature programming, our ever-popular game shows! All your old favorites are returning, including <i>Star Wars Movie Quotes Trivia</i>, <i>Wheel of Fandom</i>, <i>Sci-fi/Fantasy Pyramid</i>, and <i>Fandom Feud</i>! And if that isn't enough, we'll also be introducing a brand-new game show for I-CON this year, <i>Name That Sci-Fi Tune</i>!
</p>
<p class="para">
All this and much more will be waiting for you at I-CON 31! We'd love to see you there!
